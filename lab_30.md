# Lab 3.1: Guessing Game

In this lab, you will use conditional statements and variables to build a simple number guessing game.

##I'm Thinking of a Number...

1.  Write a SNAP program to choose a random number between 1 and 10 (using the block ![pick random 1 to 10](random.png)) and then ask the user for a number between 1 and 10.  If the two numbers match, say "You win!"  Otherwise, say "Sorry, that is not correct."  In either case, say what the program's number was.

2.  Modify the program to keep asking the user for guesses until the correct number is input.  Be sure to still give a message after each guess, but only reveal the number when the game is over.

3.  Add code to ask the player their name at the start of the game.  Then, personalize the message for an incorrect guess by adding the player's name.  For example, if Sarah is playing the game, then say "Sorry, Sarah, that is not correct" instead of just "Sorry." 

##Game Upgrades

1.  Modify your program so that the player can decide what the range of possible numbers should be.  After asking the player's name, ask what he or she wants the highest possible number to be.  Then, instead of always choosing a number between 1 and 10, choose a number between 1 and whatever number the player requested.

2.  Add code to keep track of how many guesses the player has made.  After the player guesses correctly, inform him or her how many guesses it took before the correct number was guessed.

3.  Increase the player's chances by telling him or her whether the guessed number is too high or too low instead of just that it is incorrect.
