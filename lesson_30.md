# Lesson 3.1

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

-   Use variables to track values throughout a program
-   Explain the differences between global, local (script) and instance (sprite) variables

## Materials/Preparation

-   [Lab 2.4 handout (Guessing Game)](lab_24.md)

## Instructor's Notes

1.  Lecture
    -   Review user input, specifically the "answer" block
        -   Ask students to speculate about how the "answer" block works
        -   Ask students whether that type of functionality could be useful in other cases
    -   Introduce variables
        -   Explain the concept of a variable as a way of storing a value for retrieval later
        -   Emphasize use of descriptive, readable names 
        -   Discuss the fact that each variable can only hold one value at a timeâ€”changing the value causes the old value to be lost
        -   Emphasize that variables are independent
            -   One variables value can be assigned to another, but the second variable will not update if the first's value changes again
    -   Discuss the three different types of variables (global, sprite, and script)
        -   Ask students to suggest when each might be useful
        -   Ask students and/or provide examples of when using the wrong type of variable might be dangerous or suboptimal
2.  Activity
    -   Students should complete the Guessing Game activity individually or in pairs
        -   Encourage students to think about which type of variable is most appropriate each time a variable is needed.
3.  Debrief
    -   Discuss and demonstrate one or more students' submissions.
    -   Encourage discussion about choices for variable names and types.

## Accommodations/Differentiation

-   Advanced students can add a "high score" feature to the game and/or implement additional statistics (average guesses/game, number of times each secret number chosen, etc.)
    -   Struggling students can be given code that completes part 1.1, and possibly part 1.2, to get them started.
    -   Students who are particularly overwhelmed should focus only on parts 1.2 and 2.2.
